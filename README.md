Longevity AI Coach is a personalized, privacy-first agent designed to help users extend their healthy lifespan through data-driven, evidence-based recommendations. It connects seamlessly to a user's Fitbit account, extracting granular biometric data such as heart rate variability, sleep patterns, physical activity, and resting heart rate. These signals are processed, structured, and interpreted through a layer of intelligent reasoning powered by large language models (LLMs), creating an individualized feedback loop that supports better long-term health decisions.

Unlike generic wellness apps, this project emphasizes trust and scientific transparency. Supplement suggestions are not only tailored to a user's biometric trends and goals but are also backed by current biomedical research, citing PubMed articles and clinical trial evidence. A built-in crawler ranks third-party supplements from trusted marketplaces (e.g., Labdoor, Examine.com, Amazon), applying filters to ensure recommendations are lab-verified and user-reviewed. Users can also follow up with natural language queries to understand the rationale behind each recommendation, creating an interactive experience that demystifies health optimization.

The system is structured around modular components—data ingestion, prompt engineering, product verification, and report generation—making it flexible and extensible for developers and researchers. Whether integrated into a broader health stack or used as a standalone coaching tool, it offers a solid foundation for rapid iteration in the preventive healthcare space. Daily insights can be consumed in-browser, logged to Sheets, or eventually piped into mobile apps for push-based engagement.

Ultimately, this project embodies the vision of a proactive digital health companion—one that empowers users with meaningful, personalized guidance derived from their own data, not generalized averages. It sits at the intersection of generative AI, wearable tech, and open biomedical research, and aims to lower the barrier to preventive care while maintaining respect for user privacy and scientific rigor.
